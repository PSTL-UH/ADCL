ADCL: Abstract Data and Communication Library

ADCL is an application level communication library aiming auto-tuning for application level communication patterns and collective 
communication operations. Conceptually, ADCL provides for each supported communication pattern multiple implementations and 
incorporates a runtime selection logic in order to choose the implementation leading to the highest performance of the application 
on the current platform.
