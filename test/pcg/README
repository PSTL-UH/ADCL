 - pcg: a fault tolerant implementation of a parallel conjugant 
        gradient solver taken from the Harness 1.0.1 distribution.

 Note. For the pcg example, users need to edit the pcg/main.c file
 to set the path to the initial matrix correctly. It is recommended
 that you use a fully qualified path. Also note, that additionally
 to the small input file available here, I do have a number of larger 
 ones, that I simply do not want to commit to the svn server due to
 their size.
