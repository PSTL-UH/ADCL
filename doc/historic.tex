\section{Historic Learning}

Historic Learning is a feature of ADCL that allows an application to transfer tuning
information across multiple executions/runs. It requires additional
functionality, that most function-sets (including predefined function sets) do
not provide out of the box. Specifically, right now only the neighborhood
communciation function set has support for historic learning and has been
evaluated. Users should be cautios with using this features especially for
non-blocking operations. 

We provide some of the fundamental structures and functions here. Please
contact us however back if you would like to utilize this features of ADCL for
your function-sets.

The interfaces in ADCL 
\begin{verbatim}
/* Function to register history functions to a function set */
int ADCL_Fnctset_reg_hist_fnct ( ADCL_Hist_functions hist_functions,
ADCL_Fnctset fnctset );

/* Structure holding the history functions and related information */
struct ADCL_hist_functions_s{
    ADCL_hist_reader    *hf_reader; /* Hist reading function */
    ADCL_hist_writer    *hf_writer; /* Hist writing function */
    ADCL_hist_filter    *hf_filter; /* Filter function according to the given criteria */
    ADCL_hist_distance  *hf_distance; /* Distance function between two Hist */
};

/* Function to register criteria function to a given ADCL request */
int ADCL_Request_reg_hist_criteria ( ADCL_Request req, ADCL_Hist_criteria hist_criteria);

/* Structure holding the criteria and function to set them */
struct ADCL_hist_criteria_s{

    void                *hc_filter_criteria; /* Filter criteria structure */
    ADCL_hist_set_criteria *hc_set_criteria; /* Function setting the filter criteria structure */
    int                     hc_criteria_set; /* Flag whether the filtering criteria are set */
};
\end{verbatim}

The prototypes for the read, write, filter and distance functions are as follows.
\begin{verbatim}
/* ADCL History functions types definition */
typedef void ADCL_hist_reader ( FILE *fp, ADCL_Hist hist);
typedef void ADCL_hist_writer ( FILE *fp, ADCL_Hist hist);
typedef int ADCL_hist_filter ( ADCL_Hist hist, void *filter_criteria );
typedef double ADCL_hist_distance ( ADCL_Hist hist1 , ADCL_Hist hist2 );
typedef void ADCL_hist_set_criteria ( ADCL_Request request, void *filter_criteria );
/* Other history related data types */
\end{verbatim}
