\section{Vectors and Vector-sets}

An {\tt ADCL\_Vectors} specifies the data structures to be used during the communication and the actual data. The user can for example {\it register} a data structure such as a vector or a matrix with the ADCL library, detailing how many dimensions the object has, the extent of each dimension, the number of halo-cells, the basic datatype of the object, and the pointer to the data array of the object.
